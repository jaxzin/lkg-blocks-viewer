# Three Cube Experiment

Playing around with [three.js](https://threejs.org/) to eventually get past of just creating basic shapes with random colors. 

specific goals: 
- make the gradient move 
- implement basic lambertian reflectance
- make the cube wiggle with a vertex shader

(I wish there were checkboxes âœ¨, feel the same way? [vote!](https://support.glitch.com/t/support-for-gfm-checkboxes-in-markdown/2976))
